								<h2>Industry Experience</h2>
							</header>

							<p>Applying my knowledge from personal projects, class projects, and BURPG projects, I have landed and completed 3 internships in the aerospace industry: my first two were at GE Aviation and my third at Physical Sciences, Inc. While being in the aerospace industry for government projects inherently disallows me from revealing project images or details, I can speak at a high-level to projects I contributed to, and the skills I developed as a result.</p>
							
							
							<h3>First Internship: GE Aviation</h3>
							<p>My first internship was with GE Aviation after sophomore year in Summer 2020. The unexpected emergency of COVID-19 led GE to have to find a virtual program for hundreds of interns in place of its normal rotational co-op program. Because of this, we were placed in an orientation program to teach us fundamentals of jet engine engineering and supply chain skills. Though I did not work on a real project, the program gave me a close study at how mechanical engineering can be applied to engine systems design through rotating components and propellant flow, and served as a great foundation to build my future propulsion skills off of. Additionally I learned the importance of supply chain skills including GE's lean six sigma principles that ensure business success for a company on top of engineering excellence. The position also allowed me to meet lead engineers in GE to network for future roles in the industry. For the final week as a capstone for our learning, we were placed in teams to use our developed supply chain skills to simulate a trade-study presentation for a new product development for a new engine, where I served as the finance lead to do cost-benefit analyses and create bills of materials.</p>
							
							<h3>Second Internship: GE Aviation</h3>
							<p>Following up, I decided to intern again with GE in Spring 2021 to apply my learning to real industry projects. Knowing that it would be in-person, I decided in-person engineering experience would be much more beneficial than continuing the virtual education that I had a poor experience with the prior fall as a junior. I was placed in Component Testing in Lynn, Massachusetts to test military aircraft fuel system components primarily for the development of the F414 and the T901 engines. The F414 is an afterburning turbofan engine for the Super Hornets and the T901 is a new turboshaft engine to replace the T700 for the Apaches and Blackhawks.</p>
							<!--<p>My projects included testing the fuel-cooled oil coolers that regulated the temperature of the F414 fluids, where the test ensures their manufacturing quality was ready for engine assembly. I designed modifications to the test stands to better support the testing and created the first comprehensive piping and instrumentation diagram for the stand so future engineers can modify the hardware easily. For the duration of my co-op, I tested and passed 20 oil coolers for production and development, ensuring on-time delivery of each F414 engine that was assembled. Additionally, running the quality tests gave the manufacturing engineers data to develop cleaner solutions to manufacture the parts.</p>
							<p>I also supported testing for the T901's fuel metering unit, testing the flight controller's ability to regulate engine fuel feed using CIMPLICITY, which is GE's in-house supervisory control and data acquisition program. CIMPLICITY allowed me to remotely control and monitor the test stand and drive the engine gearbox to test the performance of the fuel metering unit. The test allowed the controls engineers to observe the flow and pressure of the fuel to develop the software for the flight controller, ensuring development gets to the point of first engine testing by the end of the year.</p>
							<p>My team noticed I was skilled in computing systems, so I was assigned to lead a project to write and provision scripts in batch scripts, Excel/VBA, and Visual Studio to automate data acquisition of test systems. I created a system to use these scripts that I wrote in tandem with other test automation scripts written years ago, and this system saves several hours from each test of manual exporting, formatting, and uploading data to shared GE Aviation clouds. This system was prolific enough to be rolled out from the fuel systems team to all of Component Testing, and were further sent to our commercial engine component testing counterparts in Evendale, Ohio.</p>
							<p>Other projects that I supported included the development of new variable exhaust nozzle actuators for the F414, which regulates the afterburner velocity. I helped set up the test stand for the fuel-hydraulic actuators and ran initial inspection testing of the parts to prepare for endurance testing to observe the full lifecycle of the improved actuator. GE Research also sent advanced flow sensors using modern technology to be tested, so I helped set up the flow testing apparatus. By studying the test plan summary, I also created schedules to use on CIMPLICITY to automate the control of different metering valves based on conditions needed for the flow test.</p>
							<p>Another brief project I led was to build a test stand from scratch to test the flow rate of GE38 injectors after an overheating event, to ensure coking didn't occur. Smaller, recurring projects that I worked on throughout the co-op included cleaning occasional fuel components for transport, documenting non-standard fluids procedures for future reference, and maintaining the decades-old test facilities.</p>-->
							<p>I tested the fuel metering unit (FMU) of the brand-new T901 turboshaft helicopter engine. Using GE's in-house data acquisition software CIMPLICITY, I learned to use remote and automated test controls to lead tests to drive the FMU throttle while logging data for fuel flow and pressure readings. I worked alongside controls engineers who designed the logic of the FMU and constantly ran tests to redesign the software. By testing this component constantly, I helped finalize the component to validate it for full engine testing in the future.</p>

							<p>I also led a quality assurance test for the production of F414 afterburning turboprop engines, where I inspected the fuel-cooled oil coolers for manufacturing defects using a fuel flow test setup. I redesigned the test stand to more easily single out the manufacturing defects, while also creating the first piping and instrumentation diagram for the stand. The stand had existed for decades without a P&ID, and the purpose of the new P&ID was to make future adjustments to the stand easier. By leading these tests, I directly contributed to the on-time delivery of 17 F414 engines over Q1 and Q2 for GE Aviation.</p>

							<p>This co-op was my first time operating high-pressure fluid systems in-person, and exposed me to hardware that I never learned about in coursework at all. Despite learning about the theory of fluid mechanics, we were never exposed to piping, components, and instrumentation that control those mechanics. Through the co-op I learned about different valves, fittings, tubings, and sensors, as well as how to manufacture and assemble them into systems. Moreover, I learned how to apply those systems into a test stand for fluid components to acquire data for fluid flow, pressure, and temperature, as well as operate remote control systems that can actuate valves and monitor sensors. Being exposed to the hands-on part of fluid mechanics narrowed my interest in mechanical engineering in fluid systems due to the fun of building systems, the wide scope of fluid applications, and the significance of fluids in propulsion technology. The co-op was a large factor in my career focus in propulsion and fluids.</p>
							
							<h3>Third Internship: Physical Sciences Inc.</h3>
							<p>My third and final internship was in Summer 2021 directly after my spring co-op, where I interned for the Propulsion and Energetics division of Physical Sciences Inc. to design and test advanced rocket propulsion methods for government contracts.</p>
							<p>The main contract I worked on at PSI was a hypergolic propulsion test stand. I designed certain structural components of the test stand, which had to be enclosed and sealed due to the hazard of hypergolic propellants. I built a large portion of the structural and fluid systems of the test stand according to the design, and ran several leak tests and cold flow tests to prepare for a hotfire test. As a result of my assistance, the propulsion system was successfully hotfired before the contract ended, and new data was acquired on hydrazine combustion plumes for further research.</p>
							<p>I also built the fluid system and visual data acquisition for a rotating detonation rocket engine. For fluids, I contributed to the assembly of the pressurization and pneumatic systems that relied on the delivery of compressed air and nitrogen to pressurize the propellants and actuate valves. In data acquisition, I designed and fabricated the camera system that used surveillance cameras to provide realtime monitoring, a GoPro for high-definition footage, and a high-speed camera to image and analyze the RDRE plume. Our team was able to hotfire the base rotating detonation engine and gather data using the systems I built, while preparing to upgrade it with advanced nozzle designs for better specific impulse.</p>			
							<center><a class="image fit"><img src="rde.jpg" alt="" style="max-width:480px;text-align:center" width="100%" height="auto"/></a></center>
							<p>Many contracts also depended on the innovation of solid rocket propellant. In order to streamline future rocket motor research, I designed and manufactured two tools for the chemical engineers at PSI. One was a custom strand cutter that allows the engineers to cut a large block of solid propellant into 15 smaller strands. These strands were to be used for closed bomb testing to achieve baseline data for propellants, and the cutter saved the engineers hours of manual cutting. The other was a custom shaker table that allowed propellant to settle quicker during casting, eliminating air bubbles that would cause unstable burns when used in conjunction with a vacuum chamber. Eliminating air bubbles was a crucial blocker in scaling up the motors, and the shaker table allowed for research to proceed.</p>
							<center><a class="image fit"><img src="motor.jpg" alt="" style="max-width:480px;text-align:center" width="100%" height="auto"/></a></center>
							<p>For an explosives ordnance disposal aiming device meant to be used by military and local bomb squads to disrupt explosives, I sourced lasers for the aiming mechanism from a variety of companies around the world. I also designed a test apparatus to ensure water-resistance according to MIL-STD-810 Rain standards. The apparatus was designed to simulate violent rain with a rate of 1.7 mm/min and wind speed of 40 mph. It required a different kind of fluids design than the propellant delivery systems that I am experienced, allowing me to explore a different fluid system design from typical aerospace applications.</p>
