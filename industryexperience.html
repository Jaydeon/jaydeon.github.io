								<h2>Industry Experience</h2>
							</header>

							<p>Applying my knowledge from personal projects, class projects, and BURPG projects, I completed 3 internships in the aerospace industry: my first two were at GE Aviation and my third was at Physical Sciences Inc. While being in the aerospace industry for government work prohibits the display of non-public project images or details, I am able to give an overview of propulsion systems I worked on, the results that benefited the company, and the skills I developed while working.</p>
							<p><i>NOTE: All following images and videos displayed are publically accessible.</i></p>
							
							
							<h3>First Internship: GE Aviation</h3>
							<p>My first internship was with GE Aviation after sophomore year in Summer 2020. The unexpected emergency of COVID-19 led General Electric to develop a virtual program for over 300 interns in place of its rotational co-op program. Because of this, we were placed in an orientation program to teach us fundamentals of jet engine engineering and supply chain skills. Though I did not work on a real project, the experience broke down and exposed how mechanical engineering is applied to engine systems design through rotating turbomachinery and propellant flow, and served as the foundation for future propulsion skills. I learned the importance of the supply chain, including GE's lean six sigma principles that ensure business success in tandem with engineering excellence. The position also allowed me to network with senior engineers to learn about roles in the business. </p>
							
							<p>During the final week, we were assigned in teams to apply our learned fundamentals in a simulated New Product Introduction environment through Tollgates 3, 6, and 10 for a new engine. I served as the Finance Lead to lead cost-benefit analyses and create bills of materials.</p>

							<h3>Second Internship: GE Aviation</h3>
							<p>Following up, I decided to intern again with GE in Spring 2021 during junior year to apply my learning to real industry projects. I decided in-person engineering experience would be more beneficial than continuing virtual education. I was placed in Component Testing in Lynn, Massachusetts to test military aircraft fuel system components primarily for the development of the F414 and the T901 engines. The F414 is an afterburning turbofan for the Super Hornets and the T901 is a new turboshaft that will replace the T700 for the Apaches and Blackhawks.</p>
							<!--<p>My projects included testing the fuel-cooled oil coolers that regulated the temperature of the F414 fluids, where the test ensures their manufacturing quality was ready for engine assembly. I designed modifications to the test stands to better support the testing and created the first comprehensive piping and instrumentation diagram for the stand so future engineers can modify the hardware easily. For the duration of my co-op, I tested and passed 20 oil coolers for production and development, ensuring on-time delivery of each F414 engine that was assembled. Additionally, running the quality tests gave the manufacturing engineers data to develop cleaner solutions to manufacture the parts.</p>
							<p>I also supported testing for the T901's fuel metering unit, testing the flight controller's ability to regulate engine fuel feed using CIMPLICITY, which is GE's in-house supervisory control and data acquisition program. CIMPLICITY allowed me to remotely control and monitor the test stand and drive the engine gearbox to test the performance of the fuel metering unit. The test allowed the controls engineers to observe the flow and pressure of the fuel to develop the software for the flight controller, ensuring development gets to the point of first engine testing by the end of the year.</p>
							<p>My team noticed I was skilled in computing systems, so I was assigned to lead a project to write and provision scripts in batch scripts, Excel/VBA, and Visual Studio to automate data acquisition of test systems. I created a system to use these scripts that I wrote in tandem with other test automation scripts written years ago, and this system saves several hours from each test of manual exporting, formatting, and uploading data to shared GE Aviation clouds. This system was prolific enough to be rolled out from the fuel systems team to all of Component Testing, and were further sent to our commercial engine component testing counterparts in Evendale, Ohio.</p>
							<p>Other projects that I supported included the development of new variable exhaust nozzle actuators for the F414, which regulates the afterburner velocity. I helped set up the test stand for the fuel-hydraulic actuators and ran initial inspection testing of the parts to prepare for endurance testing to observe the full lifecycle of the improved actuator. GE Research also sent advanced flow sensors using modern technology to be tested, so I helped set up the flow testing apparatus. By studying the test plan summary, I also created schedules to use on CIMPLICITY to automate the control of different metering valves based on conditions needed for the flow test.</p>
							<p>Another brief project I led was to build a test stand from scratch to test the flow rate of GE38 injectors after an overheating event, to ensure coking didn't occur. Smaller, recurring projects that I worked on throughout the co-op included cleaning occasional fuel components for transport, documenting non-standard fluids procedures for future reference, and maintaining the decades-old test facilities.</p>-->
							<p>I supported testing of the electronic fuel metering unit of the novel T901 engine. Using GE's automated control system CIMPLICITY, I learned to use remote and automated test controls to lead tests driving the FMU throttle while logging data for fuel flow and pressure readings. I worked alongside controls engineers who designed the logic of the FMU and ran tests to ensure nominal flow and pressure output. Through high-cadence testing, I supported finalizing the component for future fully-assembled engine testing.</p>

							<p><i>Computer-generated model of T901 engine assembly with improvement metrics from GE Aviation.</i></p>
							<p>I led quality testing for production F414 engines, where I monitored the manufacturing defects of the fuel-cooled oil coolers through a flow quality setup. I redesigned the test stand components to single out the manufacturing defects, and created the first-ever piping and instrumentation diagram for the decades-old stand to make future maintenance easier. By leading these, I ensured on-time delivery of 17 F414 engines over Q1 and Q2.</p>

							<p>This co-op was my first time operating high-pressure fluid systems, and exposed me to hardware that I never learned about in coursework. Despite learning fluid mechanics, we were never exposed to piping, components, and instrumentation that control those mechanics. Through the co-op I learned about different valves, fittings, tubings, and sensors, as well as how to manufacture and assemble them into systems. I learned how to apply the assembled systems into a test stand for components to acquire data for flow, pressure, and temperature, as well as operate control systems that can actuate valves and read sensors.</p>
							<p>Being exposed to hands-on fluid mechanics narrowed my interest into fluid systems due to the fun of building systems, the wide scope of fluid applications, and the significance of fluids for propulsion. The co-op was therefore a large factor in my future career decision to pursue propulsion and fluids.</p>
							
							<h3>Third Internship: Physical Sciences Inc.</h3>
							<p>My third and final internship was in Summer 2021 after junior year and right after the spring co-op, where I interned for the Propulsion and Energetics group of Physical Sciences Inc. to design and test advanced rocket propulsion methods for government SBIR contracts.</p>
							<p>The main contracted I worked on was a UDMH-NTO hypergolic propulsion test stand. I designed certain structural components of the test stand, which had to be enclosed and sealed due to the cancerous nature of hypergolic propellants. I built a large portion of the structural and fluid systems of the test stand according to the design, and ran several leak tests and cold flow tests to prepare for a hotfire test. The propulsion system was successfully hotfired because of the systems I built, and novel data was acquired on hydrazine combustion plumes.</p>
							<p>I built the fluid system and camera system for a rotating detonation rocket engine. For fluids, I supported the assembly of the pressurization and pneumatic systems that relied on the delivery of compressed air and nitrogen to pressurize the propellants and actuate valves. In data acquisition, I designed and fabricated the camera system that included surveillance cameras, a GoPro, and a high-speed camera to give camera footage for different functions. The RDRE was able to hotfire a baseline test supported by the systems I built.</p>

							<p><i>PSI testing thrust performance on rotating detonation rocket engine.</i></p>
							<p>In order to streamline future solid rocket propellant research for our chemical engineers, I designed and manufactured two tools. One was a custom strand cutter that allows the engineers to cut a large block of solid propellant into smaller strands. These strands were to be used for closed bomb testing to achieve burn data, and the cutter saved on hours of manual cutting. The other was a custom shaker table that allowed propellant to settle quicker during casting, eliminating air bubbles that would cause unstable burns, when the table is used in conjunction with a vacuum chamber. Eliminating air bubbles was a crucial blocker in creating larger casts.</p>

							<p><i>PSI's solid propellant motors that are mixed and casted with formulations developed in-house.</i></p>
							<p>For an explosives ordnance disposal aiming device meant to be used by bomb squads, I sourced lasers for the aiming mechanism from global companies. I also designed a test apparatus to ensure water-resistance according to MIL-STD-810 Rain standards, simulating heavy rain and violent wind. The nature of dispensing water required different fluid system design than propellant delivery systems I'm used to, exposing me to a new type of fluid system design from typical aerospace applications.</p>
							<p>At this internship, I refined my knowledge on building fluid systems and operating test stands specifically for rockets, by being exposed to a larger scale than I had been at GE, where I only tested components. By building testbeds for entire engines, my skills in fluids were pushed and grew. I further narrowed my interest into testing rocket engines when I witnessed my first engine hotfiring, which came with nerve-wracking stress but also an unmatched excitement to see the performance of systems I built. Whether it failed in a spectacular explosion or succeeded in a perfect plume, the result would be worth the labor spent designing and building.</p>
							
							<h3>Future: Space Exploration Technologies and ABL Space Systems</h3>
							<p>After graduation at BU, I will be moving to Los Angeles to work in my dream industry for developing next-generation space vehicles. I will work at SpaceX for the summer developing the Raptor engine capable of interplanetary manned spaceflight, and then afterwards work at ABL Space Systems to design and operate test and launch infrastructure for the low-cost, no-frills RS1 rocket. I hope to take my excitement and knowledge from PSI to these roles and shape the future of rocket launches.</p>
