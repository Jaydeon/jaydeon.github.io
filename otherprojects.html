								<h2>Other Projects</h2>

							<p>Outside of my core aerospace projects, I've supplemented my knowledge as a mechanical engineer with proficiency in experimentation, manufacturing, electronics, and programming in smaller projects where these skills play a more central role.</p>
							<p><b>Spring 2018</b> - As a high schooler, I used Stencyl to program a Flash space exploration platformer game, and also designed the art and music. The game featured an alien reclaiming his planet from invaders in a set of levels, and I called it Spaceman. I finished designing most of the major game mechanics typically of a platformer, which included 2D protagonist control, a health system, environment interaction, and enemy AI. I also completed the design of a prologue cutscene and one game level before not having enough time to invest in the project.</p>
							<p><strong>Fall 2018</strong> - For my first-year design project in Introduction to Engineering, I programmed and completed a Kinect motion-sensor game based on Space Invaders. The coding was based in C# with GridSandbox as a template, and I designed the game logic to involve the motion-control cursor being able to shoot oncoming rows of enemies for score, until all health is lost. I also drew art to support the project, changing the template from a basic grid to a space environment with ships and aliens. I was voted and awarded the second best game design in the entire class, and so the game is now displayed on Boston University's Photonics Center Kinect screen, open for all students to play.</p>
							<p><strong>Summer 2019</strong> - I worked in the Bunch Research Group to support research in atomically two-dimensional materials for their mechanical properties. I learned processes for mechanical exfoliation of graphene as well as chemical vapor deposition for growth of tungsten diselenide (WSe2). I adjusted variables including reactant masses, cook time, and oven temperature to optimize the growth of WSe2 to have large enough membranes for the PhD students to conduct research on. I recorded ever experiment of WSe2 growth with all variables, allowing the group to use the data to continue the optimization experiments.</p>
							<p><strong>Spring 2019</strong> - In BURPG, I was assigned as one of two first-years to build the tank stand for Citadel, a gaseous bipropellant rocket engine test stand, as my first main project. The purpose of Citadel was to serve as the testbed for Mortise, a gaseous oxygen-methane spherical rocket engine. The tank stand was the supporting structures that held the propellant tanks for oxygen and methane in place. As I did not design the stand, I had to quickly learn the project statement of Citadel and its design, in order to understand how to fabricate the design. Using the campus job shops to machine the aluminum and wooden stock, I learned to use the mill, drill, and bandsaw to machine the components of the stand.</p>
							<p><strong>Spring 2019</strong> - For my sophomore design project, I designed, manufactured, and tested feminine hygiene product dispenser with smart sensors for Introduction to Engineering Design. The final prototype consisted of a reliable button-activated dispensing mechanism using Arduino, a cooldown timer to prevent overuse, an photoelectric-based emptiness sensor that sent text messages when depleted, and a lock and key set for security. As a group of 5 with 4 mechanical engineers and 1 biomedical engineer, I took the initiative to learn circuits and coding in the absence of a computer or electrical engineer, and served as the Arduino programming lead while the others worked on CAD and machining the mechanisms and housing. Our prototype was successful in demonstrating dispensing of both types of feminine hygiene products while also displaying upgrades from standard dispensers by preventing overuse and notifying for emptiness, which earned us an A- overall.</p>
							<p><strong>Summer 2019</strong> - Inspired by Google Glass, I designed and prototyped smartglasses that display text on lenses. The device acts as a lense with electronics housing that can be fitted onto most pairs of prescription glasses. The text is transmitted using an OLED which is projected onto the lense, while an Android phone can connect to and adjust the OLED text using a custom app I built with MIT App Inventor. The app allows the user to display custom input text and the current time in realtime, making it a convenient heads-up display for reminders. The largest challenge was trying to machine and build the parts, due to the special tooling necessary to cut glass and mirror.</p>
							<p><strong>Summer 2019</strong> - I designed and modeled a robotic gauntlet based on Iron Man's suit. I designed it to be additively manufactured, due to not having better machines for the custom geometry of the gauntlet, and put in pin joints for all of the fingers. It is one of the better feats of CAD in my portfolio, as I tried to make it faithful to its source material. I also designed it to be fitted to my hand, and had to constantly test the components and iterate on the dimensions. With a NeoPixel ring and a muscle flex sensor, the idea was to have it act as a flashlight, whenever the forearm was flexed, to simulate repulsor technology.</p>
							<p><strong>Fall 2020</strong> - For my junior design project, I developed and manufactured an automated and sterile COVID-19 mask dispenser for Product Design. The product served to tackle a contemporary issue in COVID-19, where current mask dispensers require users to touch the possibly-infectious dispenser. We designed the product to contain a geared roller mechanism, similar to printers, while being activated by an ultrasonic sensor from the bottom. I also included an emptiness sensor using a photoelectric diode, which would light up an alert LED whenever the masks were detected to be out of stock. I served as lead Arduino programmer again due to the team consisting of 4 mechanical engineers, and I completed the coding and wiring while my teammates designed the housing and geared mechanism. Due to 2 members being remote, I also had to take part in milling and fastening most of the housing and additively manufacturing some mechanisms. Our project was able to successfully perform its individual functions in dispensing a single mask, not requiring touch to activate, and alerting maintenance when empty. We were given an A- overall.</p>
							<p><strong>Fall 2021</strong> - In my aircraft design class, I learned to use a modular spreadsheet to design a real airplane with calculations for the structures, propulsion, and aerodynamics. With a team of 3 others, we were able to design a single-engine piston plane that outperformed current bushplanes and won the award for Best Overall Design in the semester out of the entire class.</p>
							<p><strong>Spring 2021</strong> - As BURPG got closer to their first engine hotfire in half a decade, as the fluid systems lead I advised on the rebuild and upgrading of the fluid system of the test stand that had been built in 2018, as well as the preparations for the test operations. Upgrades that were made that I advised on included a high-flow fire suppression system designed for carbon dioxide and an automated pressure relief system to vent out pressurant in case the control system loses power. I also used my industry knowledge to advise on how to oxidizer clean components and helped standardize ultrasonic cleaning procedures for the first time for the team; in the process I learned to disassemble and reassemble parts of the stand, which is necessary for moving it to the test site.</p>
