								<h2>Liquid Rocket Engine Feed System</h2>
							</header>

							<p>Pursuit is a liquid bipropellant rocket developed by the Boston University Rocket Propulsion Group, propelled by a nitrous oxide-isopropyl alcohol engine that is pressure-fed by nitrogen. The goal of the feed system is to deliver the N2O and IPA from the tanks to the engine at their required inlet pressure, density, and mass flow rate using an onboard nitrogen pressurization system to drive the fluids.</p>

							<h3>Feed System Design</h3>
							<p>As a junior in Spring 2021, I took on leading the design of this system, as well as leading the overall vehicle fluid systems team after the initial system lead stepped down to prepare for graduation. Being on the gas generator system previously, I was unfamiliar with the technical details of the feed system, which had already been taken past the preliminary design phase by the former lead designers. At the beginning of the semester, the Pursuit lead engineers decided to remove complex systems from the vehicle, which meant the fluid systems also had to be quickly redesigned before being cleared for its critical design phase. However, I was able to learn the fluid concepts involved at a rapid pace and finish out the re-design, leading it through a critical design review by the end of the semester.</p>
							<p>Firstly, I had to adjust the feed system architecture to remove active pressurization controls and the gas generator system. The gas generator was used to generate hot exhaust gases to heat up pressurant to increase the efficiency of the propellant feed, while the active pressurization controls were bang-bang controls used to regulate both the temperature and pressure of the fluids to keep it at nominal conditions. Both increased the performance of the vehicle, but were considered complex enough to require their own testing campaign; COVID-19 created logistical complications that already pushed our timeline back one year, so the team had to scrap these systems. These changes were first reflected in the piping and instrumentation diagram, which taught me how to use Visio and read P&IDs. </p>
							<p>With the removed complex systems, we decided to move the propellant fill valves from the airframe to fin can, as the propellants would no longer be used for the gas generator in the airframe. This allows us to fill and dump the propellant using the same valves, further simplifying the system. Removing components meant the calculated pressure budget for the pressurization system also had to change. Fortunately, the previous lead created a MATLAB script to automatically calculate the pressure budget given fluid properties, vehicle requirements, and a list of components. However, using the tool nevertheless required intuition for high-pressure fluid system losses, so I learned how to calculate component pressure drops for incompressible and compressible flow to use the tool and redo the pressure budget.</p>
							<p>Once the P&ID was adjusted, we referenced it to remove components that had already been selected for the preliminary design review. All of the components had already been chosen with direct purchase links, so we only had to remove components related to the active pressurization and gas generator, and check that the remaining components were still rated properly for the fluid state points. This ended up taking out nearly half of the components in the system and as expected, simplified the feed system a great deal. With the component selection finalized, we compiled the specifications into a document for our industry advisors to audit as a mini-design review. The document format proved to be much more efficient than arduously presenting every specification for each component in a video meeting, which was done for the preliminary design review. Because of this, the format that I made was reused for the ground support equipment components review as well.</p>
							<p>With the P&ID and components list finalized, I also took over modeling the feed system in Solidworks, starting nearly from scratch. Completing the feed system CAD taught me how to route piping and component assemblies, where the biggest challenge was to find a configuration to fit the components in the small space allotted in the airframe and fin can of the vehicle, and connect every component with manfuacturable tube bends. As a result, this became the most intense CAD modeling I have completed and is to-date my best demonstration of my ability to use Solidworks.</p>
							<p>Throughout the semester as the responsible fluids engineer, I also worked on interfacing the feed system with the avionics, ground support, and structures subsystems of Pursuit. With avionics, I ensured every thermocouple and transducer that was chosen had output voltages that work with the vehicle microcontroller. With structures, I worked with the bulkhead designers to finalize fittings for fluid ports, and created mounting hardware to attach onto the airframe. With the ground support system, I worked with the vehicle-GSE interface designer to select hoses and quick disconnects to connect the two systems, finalized filling operations for launch, and gave vehicle flow and pressure requirements for the ground support component selection.</p>

							<h3>Fluid Systems Operations</h3>
							<p>Alongside finishing the design for the feed system, I also was responsible as the system engineer for drafting a concept of operations for the vehicle test and launch. This was a great learning experience particularly because of the expertise required to handle nitrous oxide, which we used as our oxidizer. The base knowledge from this can be expanded and applied to even more difficult cryogenic propellants, such as industry-standard LH2, LCH4, LOX. Alongside the ground systems lead, we collaborated to create a document for the operations to fill and launch the vehicle, both in the ground testing and launch scenarios, to understand how to handle the fluids.</p>
							<p>While isopropyl alcohol and nitrogen were relatively straightforward in that they would be handled at their ambient temperature conditions provided by vendors (IPA is ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure, while N2 is ambient temperature and 6000 psig), nitrous oxide requires density conditioning to reach -22 F as required by the engine design. This conditioning is required to compress nitrous oxide to be as close to a liquid as possible, given that N2O is semi-gaseous and self-pressurized at 745 psig at ambient temperature, and required special hardware to be designed into the feed system to become mostly liquid to mitigate the dangers of using gaseous N2O. A vent valve was added in the oxidizer tank, as seen in the P&ID; opening this valve causes evaporative cooling as the gaseous, self-pressurized N2O vents out and expands. Eventually the cooling reaches -22 F, and following the saturated liquid thermodynamic curve, the N2O also reaches its required near-liquid density.</p>
							<p>Other considerations made in the operations design included requiring the venting to be operated in short "bursts" to prevent uncontrolled evaporative cooling to the point that the N2O solidifies, as well as preventing the N2O from flowing at a high rate that risks an explosion. The nitrogen similarly has to be filled at a controlled rate instead of fully open to prevent adiabatic heating from occurring that would damage components. The engine would be purged with lower pressure GN2 before any tests or launches to clear out any FOD or propellant remnants. We also had to decide which operations could be manually operated for system simplicity and which had to be remote controlled for personnel safety.</p>
							<p>At a high level, the final order of filling operations is manually purging the engine and opening the valves to fill the safe, ambient condition isopropyl alcohol fuel. Then the team would go to the control panel to resume the operation of pressurized fluids from a safe distance. The pressurant fill valves are opened at a controlled rate to fill the compositive-overwrapped pressure vessels, and then the fuel pressurization valves are opened to pressurize the IPA. The nitrous oxide fill valves are then opened to fill the oxidizer tank, and then vented in bursts until the required density is reached. Finally, the vehicle detaches from the ground systems via a remote quick disconnect actuator, the main engine pyro valves are opened with an igniter, and the engine itself is ignited for liftoff.</p>
							<p>Other operations I advised on included drafting an order of operations for the assembly of the fluid systems and its interfaces with parts from the vehicle structures team. I also advised on creating a test plan summary for pressure drop testing of the individual feed system components to verify the pressure budget calculations that I had done, where I led the design of the test stands for compressible gaseous flow and incompressible liquid flow.</p>
