								<h2>Gas Generator System</h2>
							</header>

							<p>Pursuit is a liquid bipropellant rocket developed by the Boston University Rocket Propulsion Group, propelled by a nitrous oxide-isopropyl alcohol engine that is pressure-fed by nitrogen. In order to maximize the performance of our pressure-fed propellants, the group researched the utilization of a modified gas generator and heat exchanger system. The goal of the system is to combust the propellants into onboard exhaust gases that increase the efficiency of our feed system, like gas generator cycles in industry. However, instead of powering turbopumps, the exhaust gases would superheat our nitrogen pressurant by 400 degrees through a shell-in-tube heat exchanger, and cause it to expand as it heats up. The result is that it takes up more volume to feed the propellants, thereby reducing the amount of nitrogen we need onboard and more critically, reducing the number of heavy compositive-overwrapped pressure vessels in the vehicle. At the end of its design, the system was projected to save 150 lbm of mass from the rocket. As a sophomore, I was placed on the team to develop the chamber for the gas generator from the beginning of Pursuit's design in Fall 2019.</p>
							<p>As my first ownership of a component from start-to-finish, I developed technical expertise for structural and fluids design when developing the gas generator chamber that would translate into propulsion development, given that the gas generator was essentially a scaled-down rocket engine.</p> 
							<p>As of Spring 2021, the team has decided to remove the gas generator system from the vehicle due to logistical complications from COVID-19. COVID-19 has pushed back our timeline by a year, as Pursuit was originally slated to launch in Summer 2021; complications in the 2020-2021 school year arose because the team no longer has access to our lab space, collaboration is limited by meetings being conducted entirely through video calls, and funding from the university has been cut down overall. Despite these challenges, several complex systems including the gas generator have been removed to ensure Pursuit gets to the launch pad in Summer 2022 to demonstrate the team's ability to engineer a liquid rocket from concept to launch. The gas generator system design and test plan has been completed by the former fluid systems lead engineer in the hopes that the team will be able to use the technology for a future vehicle.</p>
