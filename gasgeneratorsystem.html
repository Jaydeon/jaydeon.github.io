								<h2>Gas Generator System</h2>
							</header>
							<p>Pursuit is a liquid bipropellant rocket developed by the Boston University Rocket Propulsion Group, propelled by a nitrous oxide-isopropyl alcohol engine that is pressure-fed by nitrogen. In order to maximize the performance of our pressure-fed propellants, the group researched the utilization of a modified gas generator and heat exchanger system. The goal of the system is to combust the propellants into onboard exhaust gases that increase the efficiency of our feed system, like gas generator cycles in industry. However, instead of powering turbopumps, the exhaust gases would superheat our nitrogen pressurant by 400 degrees through a shell-in-tube heat exchanger, and cause it to expand as it heats up.</p>
							<p>The result is that it takes up more volume to feed the propellants, thereby reducing the amount of nitrogen we need onboard and more critically, reducing the number of heavy compositive-overwrapped pressure vessels in the vehicle. At the end of its design, the entire system was projected to save 150 lbm of mass from the rocket. As a sophomore, I was placed on the team to develop the chamber for the gas generator from the beginning of Pursuit's design in Fall 2019.</p>
							<p>As my first ownership of a component from the conceptual phase, I developed technical expertise for structural and fluids design when developing the gas generator chamber that would translate into propulsion development, given that the gas generator was essentially a scaled-down rocket engine.</p> 
							<p>With the overall goal of the gas generator to generate gases that will reduce vehicle weight, the design of this chamber different from traditional chambers in that performance of thrust is not optimized. Referencing Rocket Propulsion Elements, I started by researching into chamber geometry. While a spherical or semi-spherical design offers greater mass savings for the same performance, a cylindrical chamber was chosen for much greater ease of manufacturing; a cylindrical chamber could be simply turned while spherical chambers require multi-axis milling or additives. At under 2 inches long, the small scale of the gas generator also meant that the mass difference would be negligible, making spherical a poor trade-off.</p>
							<p>Having chosen the cylindrical design, I then looked into chamber length and diameter calculations. We chose to constrain the diameter with the injector's diameter for simplicity of interfacing, and used that diameter to drive the chamber length. Based on characteristic length and stay time equations, we backed out the minimum length for complete combustion using a characteristic length of 35 inches. N2O and IPA is not commonly used in industry as a bipropellant so without industry data, we used the team's heritage characteristic length from Lotus Dev 2, the N2O-IPA engine that is used as Pursuit's propulsion system.</p>
							<p>Researching into materials next, we decided to forgo any cooling system on the gas generator due to complexity at the small scale of the system. Because of this and the system's operation for the duration of flight, it was essential to find a material that would not yield under the combustion temperature and pressure. Stainless steel was the most economical choice, with AISI 304 being chosen for having sufficient performance under a factor of safety. Other materials commonly used for chambers included aluminum, iron, copper, and titanium which were not up-to-specification to be used because of the lack of passive or active cooling. Superalloys were also considered including inconel and hastelloy, though stainless steel's performance at a much more lower cost point made it optimal.</p> 
							<p>To interface with the injector at the top of the chamber and the heat exchanger at the bottom of the chamber, sealing geometry had to be considered. Directly interfacing with the injector, two o-rings were used to prevent the combustion gases from escaping the chamber; double sealing is a standard for multi-propellant sealing for safety of our vehicle and personnel. I researched proper polymers for a stainless steel interface as well as the correct o-ring sizes and required compressive forces. For the heat exchanger interface, the gases are fed into a tube in the heat exchanger, so an SAE boss port was designed to be brazed onto the chamber for the tube to seal. Unlike typical chambers, choking is not necessary, nor desired, as it is not meant to be used as thrust, so we chose a 3/8" boss port as the minimum tubing diameter before choking.
							<p>I then modeled the chamber in Solidworks to present as a conceptual design review and preliminary design review. I took a gap semester from BURPG after finishing the chamber design to study abroad. After returning to work in the team in the summer, the chamber design was ready for manufacturing. As such, I transitioned to working to finish the heat exchanger part of the gas generator system. The heat exchanger was finished designed, but required FEA to analyze the thermal-structural stresses seen from rapid temperature changes. I worked to learn ANSYS to develop the finite element analysis, though it proved to require lengthy research into analysis because of a lack of team experience in thermal-structural analysis for such a complicated component. I researched the analysis throughout Summer 2020 and continued to develop the ANSYS model in Fall 2020.</p>
							<p>In parallel with learning ANSYS, I led and completed the design of the mounting hardware in the fall for the gas generator system, to attach the system to the airframe of the rocket. Calculating stresses seen from the acceleration of the rocket and the mass of the system, I chose off-the-shelf L-brackets and bolts that would sufficiently support the system throughout flight within a margin of safety. These were modeled into the system assembly, and used to complete the FEA model.</p>
							<p>As of Spring 2021, the team has decided to remove the gas generator system from the vehicle due to logistical complications from COVID-19. COVID-19 has pushed back our timeline by a year, as Pursuit was originally slated to launch in Summer 2021; complications in the 2020-2021 school year arose because the team no longer has access to our lab space, collaboration is limited by meetings being conducted entirely through video calls, and funding from the university has been cut down overall. Despite these challenges, several complex systems including the gas generator have been removed to ensure Pursuit gets to the launch pad in Summer 2022 to demonstrate the team's ability to engineer a liquid rocket from concept to launch. While I transitioned into the role of lead fluids engineer to close out the still-existing feed system design before the end of the spring, the gas generator system design and test plan has been completed by the former fluid systems lead in the hopes that the team will be able to use the technology for a future vehicle.</p>
