								<h2>Model Rockets</h2>
							</header>

							<p>Though model rockets are simple compared to rockets developed in industry and even rockets developed in college teams, I gained early design experience as a high schooler developing model rockets in CAD and OpenRocket. Launching these small rockets also solidified my interest in rocketry and was key to my decision to join the Boston University Rocket Propulsion Group, which has given me the resources to take my initial knowledge of model rocketry and expand it into amateur rocketry.</p>
							
							<h3>First Rocket: Dawn & Dusk</h3>
							<p>My first design and launch was a C-class rocket in my senior year of high school in Spring 2018. I wanted to start with a safer, smaller rocket that could be rapidly iterated with my school's limited additive technology, so I designed the rocket for 18mm motors, limiting my selection to A, B, and C-class motors. Not understanding recovery deployment too well either, I opt to have the lightweight rocket tumble back down.</p>
							<p>I based the design off of researching existing model rockets. In OpenRocket I optimized the vehicle to be as lightweight as possible to maximize the apogee. In doing so, I also decided to go with a C-class motor to have the highest possible launch based the vehicle constraints. After designing it in OpenRocket, I modeled the rocket in Autodesk Inventor, which was at the time sponsored by my school and my main program of CAD. Splitting the rocket into individual components for ease of printing, I then loaded them into .STL files and printed them using my high school's Flashforge Dreamer.</p>
							<p>My biggest setback was in assembling the vehicle components. Lacking 3D printing experience, my first few attempts to print the rocket in different configurations came out in either failed prints or broken assemblies. Eventually, I learned to separate the rocket into three components: the nose cone, the airframe, and the fin can. At first I had tried to print the fins separately from the airframe to glue them on later, only for them to fall off under relatively low stresses. Realizing that I could print the fins onto a fin can made gluing the individual components far easier.</p>
							<p>Finally in June 2018 I was able to launch the rocket, named "Dawn", on a clear day in a grass field. The rocket was unfortunately unstable and veered into a horizontal trajectory. Most likely, it tumbled to the side due to an imperfect launch angle and uneven weight distribution from the launch lug on the fin can. Lacking prior launch experience, I didn't have much knowledge in stability. I attempted to launch the same vehicle a second time to determine if I had simply operated the launch mechanism incorrectly, but the same uncontrolled ascent occurred. It was actually worse the next time because the first launch had broken a fin, which I had to glue back on imperfectly.</p>
							<p>Having optimized a lightweight vehicle so much to optimize the apogee, I never considered stability, center of gravity, or center of pressure as a factor of launch. Nevertheless, I was extremely happy to see a scratch-built rocket launch, even if it was unstable. Being my first launch experience, it remains one of my first real engineering projects and a very memorable day in high school. I had planned to research more into the OpenRocket design, as I still had a third C-class motor. However, I was out of time with my high school resources as the semester closed and was unable to assemble the near-identical, but improved, rocket, now aptly named "Dusk", to launch a third time. The rocket contained a lengthened, stable body and a rudimentary parachute system. My intention was to build it in college and then bring it home to launch over summer break of freshman year.</p>

							<h3>Second Rocket</h3>
							<p>After freshman year of college in Summer 2019 and having learned more fundamentals about recovery, stability, and launch from BURPG, I wanted to launch a more refined and powerful design to apply my learning. Having had more experience in hands-on engineering overall from my coursework, I also machined a custom launch pad and wired a custom launch controller from scratch. The launch pad is simply a metal disc with 3D-printed legs and a steel launch rod. The launch controller, like commercial launch controllers, uses batteries to send an electrical charge to motor igniters, and also contains a safety key in series that opens the circuit when unplugged. Though I haven't launched any more rockets and at the moment don't plan to, these systems can be reused for future low-powered rockets.</p>
							<p>I chose mid-powered F-class motors as they are the second highest power commercial rocket motors available without certification, and G-class motors are not available to purchase under university resources. Confident in my ability to engineer a rocket with guidance from my BURPG teammates who have launched high-powered rockets and amateur rockets, I wanted to launch a rocket that could push the limits of model rocketry</p>
							<p>Once again designing around the motor, I simulated the vehicle in OpenRocket with similar geometry to Dawn and Dusk. Once again I minimized weight while maximizing apogee, but this time I kept stability above 1 caliber by adjusting the mass distribution in parallel with maximizing apogee. With the design compelete, I modeled it in Solidworks and printed the design using a Prusa i3 in PLA. The rocket was printed once again using the heritage assembly of nose cone, body, and fin can, with epoxy keeping the parts together.</p>
							<p>Though I designed Dusk to be able to attach to a parachute, I hadn't completed research on parachutes, which I intended to use on this new rocket. I realized that had I finished Dusk, it probably wouldn't have fit a parachute inside. However, the new rocket had ample room thanks to an increased diameter and length. The parachute system is a plastic sheet attached to the rocket with nylon fishing lines. I sized the parachute with a calculator and tested it with a low-risk balcony drop.</p>

							<!--<h3>Rocket Car</h3>
							<p>With the decision to design a F-class vehicle, I still had one C-class motor left from high school. Not wanting it to go to waste and still wanting to further my experience with motors, I looked into testing a horizontally-launched vehicle. In Solidworks, I modeled a car with an aerodynamic chassis, a rocket motor mount at the back, and operational wheels and axes. I had to rapidly prototype the design with 3D printing until I figured out the correct tolerances for the wheels to roll with little resistance while still being stable on the chassis. Similarly to the rockets, I used epoxy to assemble the vehicle. I planned to launch the car down a backroad on campus that is sparsely populated in the summer, as it can function as an asphalt straightway without risks to other people.</p>
